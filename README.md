# Tweet Archive

## Searchable tweet archive, powered by Hibernate Search and Spring Boot

This is a personal tweet archive. Its purpose is to store your tweets, retweets, quoted tweets and favorites in a PostgreSQL database and provide a full text search with Hibernate Search.

## NOTE

Current version expects a PostgreSQL database running on localhost:5432 with a schema named `tweetArchive` and user `tweetArchive` with the same password.
